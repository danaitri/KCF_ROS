# KCF_ROS

Wraps the KCF tracker into a ROS package and publishes the tracked region as a custom message.

This tracking method is an implementation of [1] which is extended to KFC with color-names features [2].
The implementation is based on OpenCVs abstract class cv::Tracker.

The package tracker provides a Service node that starts the tracking process upon receiving an initialization request. 
The image frame is received from the usb_cam package.


# Dependencies

1. ROS
2. OpenCV 3.0
3. Cmake
